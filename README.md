# Huffman_compression

This project is to understand how markov models works with an understanding of transition probabililites.
And application of it in Huffman compression techniques using different block sizes. This project was done as a part of my project 
work during my Master's degree under the course Information Theory at the University of Siena, Italy.

1)The scripts consists of three files: (a)Encoder.m (b)Decoder.m (c)File_check.m
2)All the input files must be in the same directory where the scripts exists.
3)While entering the window size(block size), the user must enter the values from 1 to 8 
since the program has been done for block size upto 8.
4)While saving the compressed file, the name has to be entered in .bin format.
5)The file_check.m file is used to check whether the recovered file and original files are
same or not. For this you have to enter original text file name and the one which you
recovered. At the end both files must be equal. Since encoding is lossless.
6)The technical report is in the 'Report' folder.
